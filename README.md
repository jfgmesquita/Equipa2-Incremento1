# Programming Laboratory Project in Java - Increment 1

## Scrum (Agile)

#### Using MySQL, Git and Trello

***

The objective of this project is to develop a Java application consisting of three main components. 
- The first component aims to integrate the application with relational databases, applying object-relational mapping (ORM) techniques.
- The second component involves the development of a REST API.
- The third component focuses on creating graphical interfaces that allow efficient interaction between the user and the machine.
The program must validate the operator's actions, presenting suggestive messages when appropriate.

The project will also enable the development of transversal skills, namely: abstraction, creativity, problem-solving, autonomy, analysis and synthesis, time management, teamwork, and the practical application of theoretical knowledge.

The development process will follow an agile approach, based on SCRUM.
